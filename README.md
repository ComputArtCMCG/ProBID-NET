The checkpoint of model trained on both Chain-chain interface and domain-domain interface sets is available at https://figshare.com/s/ebbd5184c0a46fb2b179; DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.25333570.

The lists of protein-protein complex structures for the training set, the added training set, and all three test sets are available in the following files:

'Chain-chain_interface_train_set.txt'
'Added_domain-domain_interface_set.txt'
'All_3_test_set_list.txt'

After downloading the checkpoint, you can run ProBID-Net by following the steps:

1. Unzip the downloaded file and navigate to the folder
   unzip ProBID-NET-main.zip
   cd ./ProBID-NET-main/

2. Create conda environment and install keras
  conda env create -n ProBID -f environment.yaml

3. Download the checkpoint of model and save it in the 'models' fold
   
4. Prepare a list file that contains the prefix of the PDB files of protein-protein complexes and
 the chain to predict separated by '  '(i.e., '1euv.pdb  B' )

5. In the ProBID-Net_run.sh script, change 'ProBID_path=./' to either the actual path of the ProBID-Net main folder
   or leave it as the current setting if you are running the script from the ProBID-Net directory

6. Activate the ProBID env if it is not active and make predictions with
  ./ProBID-Net_run.sh [pdblist] [pdbpath]
   where [pdblist] is the file in step 2, and [pdbpath] is the path that all PDB files are stored.
7. You can find a total of six output predictions in the 'output_pred' folder,where 'xxxx.pred_0' is 
  predicted by the model with the domain-domain interface added as the training set.

Example:
In the 'Example' folder, we demonstrate how to predict the amino acids on the interface residues of Chain B in the '1euv.pdb' complex structure.
First, the '1euv.pdb' file was split into two separate structures: '1euv.pdb.A' and '1euv.pdb.B'. In the '1euv.pdb.B' file, the amino acid types 
at the interface residues of Chain B were masked as 'XXX'.
Next, the structural information from '1euv.pdb.B' was encoded into an HDF5 file named '1euv.pdb.B.hdf5', which was used as the input for ProBID-Net.
After running the prediction, the probabilities for each of the 20 natural amino acids were output and saved in the file '1euv.pdb.B.pred'.
